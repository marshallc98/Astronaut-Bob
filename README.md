# Astronaut-Bob
Unity project named Astronaut Bob

Each folder will have files related to the folder's title. Each piece is needed for the Unity project to work properly. 

All models are made using Blender.

Only known bug currently is in the collection scene. The enemy models rotate forward onto their stomach and stay that way. 
All other functions for the enemy work correctly though.

This is meant to be a silly few minute time consumer. Have fun!
